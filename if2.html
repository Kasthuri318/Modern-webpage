        <p align="center">Remember, self-care isn't selfish; it's an act of self-love that radiates outward, influencing not only your well-being but also the world around you. As the saying goes, "You can't pour from an empty cup." So, take the time to replenish your own cup, indulge in moments of tranquility, and prioritize activities that bring you joy.</p>
